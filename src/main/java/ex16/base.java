 *  UCF COP3330 Summer 2021 Assignment 16 Solution
 *  Copyright 2021 Julian Espinoza
 *
 *  Exercise 16 - Legal Driving Age
 *  Write a program that asks the user for their age and compare it to the legal driving age of sixteen. If the user is sixteen or older, then the program should display
 *  "You are old enough to legally drive." If the user is under sixteen, the program should display "You are not old enough to legally drive."
 *
 *  Constraint:
 *  Use a single output statement.
 *  Use a ternary operator to write this program. If your language doesnâ€™t support a ternary operator, use a regular if/else statement, and still use a single output statement to display the message.
